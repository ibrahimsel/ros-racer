# Own the f1tenth_gym backend
- add https://github.com/ibrahimsel/f1tenth_gym.git as a submodule (my own fork of the f1tenth_gym backend) so we could actually modify it if we need
- Vehicle hitboxes don't seem to be so accurate. Or it could be laserscan too. Research the cause

# Improve the multiagent_plugin
- Make the UI nicer and more appealing to the user
- Add more functionalities
- Start race button seems stale. It only publishes racecar robot descriptions. Why dont we just publish it as soon as the sim starts

# Improve bridge
- Improve performance
- The sim should be able to handle up to 20 agents while not compromising performance
- Add more useful and appealing visualizations & stats in general
